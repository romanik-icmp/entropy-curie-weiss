\section{Introduction}

The lattice gas models with multiple site or cell occupancy are studied much less frequently than the common classical lattice gas with maximum occupancy equal to one, i.e. the lattice gas in which cells can be either empty or occupied by a single particle~\citep{LY52,Stanley71}.

Still, the multiple occupancy lattice gas is a very interesting object with interesting physical properties~\citep{LWL98,FHL04,FL18,LYZ21}. 
Such objects has not been extensively explored yet. Entropy is one of interesting thermodynamic quantities that may exhibit non-trivial features in such models, but the available literature on this topic is very scarce.

In this study, we make an attempt to partially fill this gap by examining the entropy of a cell fluid model with a Curie-Weiss type of interaction~\citep{KKD20,KD22,RDKPS25arxiv}. It is worth noting here that we understand the lattice gas model in the same way as Stanley did, see~\citep[Appendix A]{Stanley71}. We speak of the occupancy of cells by the centers of particles, rather than restrict the atoms' positions to a discrete set of sites in a lattice, hence the term ``cell fluid model'' originates.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Model}
An open system of point particles is considered in volume $V\subset\mathbb R^3$ in three space dimensions. The total volume $V$ is partitioned into $N_v$ non-overlapping congruent cubic cells $\Delta_l$, $l\in\{1,...,N_v\}$, each of volume $v$, such that $V$ is the union of all $\Delta_l$'s:
\begin{equation}\label{volume}
	V = \bigcup_{l=1}^{N_v}\Delta_l,\qquad
	\Delta_l \cap \Delta_{l'} = \emptyset, \text{ if } l \neq l',\qquad\mbox{and}\quad
	V = v N_v.
\end{equation}
The two-particle interaction is defined as
\begin{equation}
	\label{def:curie-weiss-pot}
	\Phi_{N_v}(\vb{r}_i, \vb{r}_j) = -\frac{J_1}{N_v} + J_2\sum_{l=1}^{N_v} \mathbb{I}_{\Delta_l}(\vb{r}_i) \mathbb{I}_{\Delta_l}(\vb{r}_j).
\end{equation}
The first term in $\Phi_{N_v}$ describes a global Curie-Weiss (mean-field-like) attraction for any pair of particles in the system.
The strength of this attraction is controlled by an energy parameter $J_1 > 0$. The second term in $\Phi_{N_v}$ describes a local repulsion between two particles contained within the same cell $\Delta_l$ and is characterized by the parameter $J_2 > 0.$
Here, $\mathbb{I}_{\Delta_l}(\vb{r})$ is the indicator function of the cell $\Delta_l$,
\begin{equation}
	\label{def:I}
	\mathbb{I}_{\Delta_l} (\vb{r}) = \left\{
	\begin{array}{ll}
		1, \quad \vb{r} \in \Delta_l,
		\\
		0, \quad \vb{r} \notin \Delta_l.
	\end{array}
	\right.
\end{equation}
We refer the reader to Refs.~\citep{KKD20,KD22,RDKPS25arxiv} for a more rigorous definition of the model. The main features of the model are the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the model possesses an exact solution in the thermodynamic limit;
	
	\item for sufficiently low temperatures, the model exhibits an infinite sequence of the first-order phase transitions between fluid phases of ever increasing density.
	
	\item the phase transition lines between each pair of neighboring (adjacent) phases end with a respective critical point, thus an infinite number of critical points exist in the model.
	
\end{itemize}
The phase diagrams in both the temperature-density and pressure-temperature planes are presented in~\citep{KD22}.

One of the main results of~\citep{RDKPS25arxiv} is the explicit expressions for the entropy of the model as a function of temperature and chemical potential. In the next Section~\ref{sec:res}, we thoroughly investigate the obtained results for the entropy. 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Results}\label{sec:res}
We use the standard dimensionless thermodynamic quantities: the reduced temperature $T^*=k_{\rm B}T/J_1$, the reduced pressure $P^* = P v/J_1$, the reduced chemical potential $\mu^* = \mu/J_1$, the reduced particle density $\rho^* = \frac{\langle N \rangle}{V} v = \frac{\langle N \rangle}{N_v}$, with $T$ being the absolute temperature, $k_{\rm B}$ the Boltzmann constant, $P$ the pressure, $\mu$ the chemical potential, and $\langle N \rangle$ the average number of particles in the system, where the average is meant to be the grand-canonical-ensemble average. For the entropy $S$, the corresponding reduced quantity is
\begin{equation}
	\label{def:S1}
	S^* = \frac{S}{k_{\rm B} \langle N \rangle}.
\end{equation}
We call $S^*$ the entropy per particle. For lattice models, the entropy per cell (or the entropy per site) $S^*_v$ is also defined as
\begin{equation}
	\label{def:S2}
	S^*_v = \frac{S}{k_{\rm B} N_v}.
\end{equation}

The thermodynamic formula for the entropy per particle is
\begin{eqnarray}
	S^* & = & \frac{1}{\rho^*}\left(\frac{\partial P^*}{\partial T^*}\right)_{{\mu^*}}
	= \frac{(\partial P^* / \partial T^*)_{{\mu^*}}}{(\partial P^* / \partial \mu^*)_{T^*}}.
\end{eqnarray}
The explicit expression for $S^*$ obtained in~\citep{RDKPS25arxiv} reads
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:entropy1}
	S^*(T^*,\mu^*) = \left(\frac{3}{2} - \frac{\mu^*}{T^*}\right) - \frac{1}{T^*}\frac{K_1}{K_0} + \frac{K_0 \ln K_0}{K_1} + \frac{a}{2T^*} \frac{K_2}{K_1},
\end{equation}
where $a = J_2/J_1$, and the special functions $K_j$, with $j=0, 1, 2, \ldots$, are themselves functions of temperature $T^*$ and chemical potential $\mu^*$:
\begin{equation}
	\label{def:Kj}
	K_j(T^*,\mu^*;\bar{y}_{\rm max}) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{n^j (v^* T^{*3/2})^n}{n!} \exp[\left(\bar{y}_{\rm max}+\frac{\mu^*}{T^*}\right)n - \frac{a}{2T^*}n^2].
\end{equation}
Here $v^* = v/\lambda^3$, $\lambda = (2\pi\hbar^2/mJ_1)^{1/2}$, with $\hbar$ the Planck constant, $m$ the mass of a particle. It is interesting to note that the quantity analogous to $v^*$ was mentioned in~\citep{PGT15} in the context of a model that also allows for multiple occupancy.

The quantity $\bar{y}_{\rm max}$ in \eqref{def:Kj} is itself a function of $T^*$ and $\mu^*$. It is defined as a solution of the extremum condition
\begin{eqnarray}
	\label{cond:max}
	E_1(T^*,\mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max}) & = & 0,
	\nonumber\\
	E_2(T^*,\mu^*;\bar{y}_{\rm max}) & < & 0,
\end{eqnarray}
with functions $E_1$ and $E_2$ defined as
\begin{equation}
	\label{def:E1}
	E_1(T^*,\mu^*;y) = -T^* y + \frac{K_1(T^*,\mu^*;y)}{K_0(T^*,\mu^*;y)};
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	E_2(T^*,\mu^*;y) = -T^*+\frac{K_2(T^*,\mu^*;y)}{K_0(T^*,\mu^*;y)}
	-\left[\frac{K_1(T^*,\mu^*;y)}{K_0(T^*,\mu^*;y)}\right]^2\!.
\end{equation}

When the ideal-gas contribution to the chemical potential, $\mu_{\rm{id}} = k_{\rm{B}}T \ln(N\Lambda^3/V)$, is taken into account, it becomes evident that the first term in~\eqref{eq:entropy1} 
\begin{equation}
	S^*_{\rm id} = \frac{3}{2} - \frac{\mu^*}{T^*}
\end{equation}
represents the entropy of a system of noninteracting molecules arranged on a lattice, subject to the strict single-occupancy constraint (one particle per cell), see~\citep[(47.4)]{Hill56}.

For the entropy per cell, it is seen from \eqref{def:S1} and \eqref{def:S2} that
\begin{equation}
	S^*_v = \rho^* S^* = \left(\frac{\partial P^*}{\partial T^*}\right)_{\mu^*}.
\end{equation}
In the explicit form
\begin{eqnarray}
	\label{eq:entropy2}
	S^{*}_v(T^*,\mu^*) & = & \left(\frac{3}{2} - \frac{\mu^*}{T^*}\right)\frac{K_1}{K_0} - \frac{1}{T^*}\frac{K_1^2}{K_0^2} + \ln K_0 + \frac{a}{2T^*} \frac{K_2}{K_0}.
\end{eqnarray}
Equations~\eqref{eq:entropy1} and~\eqref{eq:entropy2} express the entropy as a function of temperature and chemical potential. To obtain the entropy dependence on the density $\rho^*$, we should account for the following equation \citep[(42)]{RDKPS25arxiv}:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:rho_in_y}
	\rho^*=\frac{K_1(T^*,\mu^*;\bar{y}_{\rm max})}{K_0(T^*,\mu^*;\bar{y}_{\rm max})}.
\end{equation}

%\subsection{Parametric representation}
Let us now represent the analytical results for entropy in the form of parametric equations. Noticing that by~\eqref{cond:max} and~\eqref{def:E1}
\begin{equation}
	\bar{y}_{\rm max} = \frac{1}{T^*}\frac{K_1(T^*,\mu^*;y)}{K_0(T^*,\mu^*;y)}
\end{equation}
and applying the following change of variables, which is the idea taken from~\citep{KD22},
\begin{equation}
	\bar{y}_{\rm max} + \frac{\mu^*}{T^*} = \bar{z}_{\rm max},
\end{equation}
we rewrite the entropy in the form
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:S_in_z}
	S^*(T^*;\bar{z}_{\rm max}) = \frac{3}{2} - \bar{z}_{\rm max} + \frac{\tilde{K}_0 \ln \tilde{K}_0}{\tilde{K}_1} + \frac{a}{2T^*} \frac{\tilde{K}_2}{\tilde{K}_1},
\end{equation}
where the special functions $\tilde{K}_j$ are now written as
\begin{equation}
	\tilde{K}_j(T^*;\bar{z}_{\rm max}) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{n^j (v^* T^{*3/2})^n}{n!} \exp[\bar{z}_{\rm max}n - \frac{a}{2T^*}n^2].
\end{equation}
The chemical potential is expressed in $\tilde{K}_j$ as
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:mu_in_z}
	\mu^* = T^* \bar{z}_{\rm max} - \frac{\tilde{K}_1(T^*;\bar{z}_{\rm max})}{\tilde{K}_0(T^*;\bar{z}_{\rm max})}.
\end{equation}
At any given temperature $T^*$, Eqs.~\eqref{eq:S_in_z} and~\eqref{eq:mu_in_z} together represent a parametric equation for the entropy $S^*$ as a function of $\mu^*$, with $\bar{z}_{\rm max}$ being the parameter.

Similarly, if Eq.~\eqref{eq:rho_in_y} is rewritten as
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:rho_in_z}
	\rho^*(T^*;\bar{z}_{\rm max}) = \frac{\tilde{K}_1(T^*;\bar{z}_{\rm max})}{\tilde{K}_0(T^*;\bar{z}_{\rm max})},
\end{equation}
then Eqs.~\eqref{eq:S_in_z} and~\eqref{eq:rho_in_z} constitute a parametric equation for the entropy $S^*$ as a function of $\rho^*$, at any given $T^*$ and with $\bar{z}_{\rm max}$ being the parameter.
The explicit expression for the entropy per cell in terms of $\tilde{K}_j$ reads
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:S2_in_z}
	S^*_v(T^*;\bar{z}_{\rm max}) = \left(\frac{3}{2} - \bar{z}_{\rm max}\right) \frac{\tilde{K}_1}{\tilde{K}_0} + \ln \tilde{K}_0 + \frac{a}{2T^*} \frac{\tilde{K}_2}{\tilde{K}_0},
\end{equation}

Before proceeding with analysis of the entropy behavior, let us recall that the considered model possesses an infinite number of critical points, and thus, an infinite number of first-order phase transitions at sufficiently low temperatures~\citep{KD22}. We call the phase with the lowest density Phase I. Then the first first-order phase transition leads to a phase with a higher density, Phase II. The second first-order phase transition results in Phase III, and so on to Phase IV, Phase V, etc. Phase diagrams in the temperature-density plane is shown in~\citep[Fig.~10]{KD22}, detailed numerical values of quantities at the first five critical points are summarized in \citep[Table~1]{RDKPS25arxiv}. For convenience, in Table~1, we report the numerical values of relevant physical quantities at the coexistence lines at temperatures $T^*=0.25$ and $T^*=0.20$.

Results for Entropy are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:entropy3}. The numerical values for the parameters are taken as $a=1.2$, and $v^*=5.0$. Each Figure contains curves for four different temperatures: the red curve is $T^* = 0.4$, which is much higher than the critical temperatures; the green curve is $T^* = 0.3$, which is slightly higher than the critical temperatures; the black curve is $T^*=0.25$, which is just slightly lower than the critical temperature; and the blue curve is $T^*=0.20$, which is significantly lower than the critical temperature. The solid parts of the curves represent the results for the stable phases, while the dashed parts correspond to two-phase regions, i.e. to solutions of $\bar{y}$ to $E_1=0$ that may violate the condition of global maxima $E_2 < 0$, see~\eqref{cond:max}. 

The dependence of the entropy per particle on the chemical potential is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:entropy3}a. For the supercritical region, Red and Green curves, the entropy has a monotonic decreasing behavior with the chemical potential $\mu^*$. For temperatures below the critical one, we observe that phase II has a lower entropy compared to Phase I, then Phase III has a lower entropy than Phase II, and so on. However, within a particular phase, except Phase I, the dependence of the entropy per particle on the chemical potential may not be monotonic. At the phase transitions, the entropy exhibits jumps from a higher value at the phase with a lower chemical potential, to a lower value at the phase with a higher chemical potential.

The dependence of the entropy per particle on the density is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:entropy3}b. For supercritical temperatures, the entropy per particle is a decreasing function of the density $\rho^*$. At temperatures lower than the critical one, the entropy is still a decreasing function of $\rho$ in Phase I, but in subsequent phases it exhibits a minimum around integer values of $\rho^*$. For the plots it is also seen that at the first-order phase transitions, the jumps in both entropy and density occur.

An important feature of the plots in Figure~\ref{fig:entropy3} is that at phases with higher densities, for Phase V and higher, the entropy becomes negative. On the one hand, it is an artifact of the classical treatment of the model. On the other hand, this behavior can also be attributed to quite small values of $v^*$, and is similar in nature to the statement by Stillinger~\cite{Stillinger76} regarding the study of the Gaussian core model: {\it{``$\ldots$ when $T>0$, the requirement that particles remain confined to a regular lattice as the spacing in that lattice goes to zero creates a diverging negative entropy that could only be offset by an unbounded energy in the same limit.''}}\\
If the value for $v^*$ is increased, we would observe many more phases with $S^*>0$, before the entropy becomes negative, but nevertheless, for each selection of $v^*$, a density will be reached where the entropy becomes negative.

The dependence of the entropy per cell on the chemical potential is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:entropy3}c. For high temperatures, i.e. $T^*=0.4$, the entropy per cell increases as a function of $\mu^*$ for negative and small positive values, then reaches a maximum, and then decreases. For temperatures just slightly above the critical one, i.e. $T^*=0.3$, the behavior of $S^*_v$ is very nontrivial, with noticeable bends around the corresponding critical points. At lower temperatures, the entropy per cell increases with $\mu^*$ in Phase I. Then in Phase II and Phase III, it has a non-monotonic behavior, but overall, these phases possess the highest entropy per cell compared to all the other phases. Then, for the consecutive phases, the entropy per cell jumps to lower values at each phase transition, while still having non-monotonic behavior within a single phase. 

The dependence of the entropy per cell on the density is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:entropy3}d. For high temperatures, i.e. $T^*=0.4$, the entropy per cell increases as a function of $\rho^*$ for small values, reaches a maximum, and then decreases. For temperatures just slightly above the critical one, i.e. $T^*=0.3$, the behavior of $S^*_v$ starts to resemble that below $T_c$, signaling the approach to critical points. At lower temperatures, the entropy per cell increases with $\rho^*$ in Phase I. Then, within each consecutive phase, it exhibits a non-monotonic behavior, and possesses minima at around integer-value $\rho^*$.
Based on the available data, even though very scarce, we assume that such behavior of the entropy versus density is a generic characteristic of cell, or lattice, models allowing for multiple occupancy, see the discussion in the next Section~\ref{sec:dis}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Discussion}\label{sec:dis}
It is not easy to find results for entropy for multiple-occupancy lattice models. Here are some examples we found in literature.

Study~\citep{dLBKGS11} thoroughly examines both entropy per site and the entropy per cell for the three-dimensional fermionic Hubbard model by the dynamical mean-field theory. In this model, the maximum occupancy (or filling) is 2. Note that their concept of the entropy per site is analoguous to our entropy per cell.
The entropy per site as a function of chemical potential is presented in~\citep[Figs.~5 and~6]{dLBKGS11}. The dependence of the entropy per site on density is shown in \citep[Fig.~7]{dLBKGS11}.
That of the entropy per particle on density is illustrated in \citep[Fig.~8]{dLBKGS11}. All Figures contain curves for multiple temperatures, and different Hamiltonian parameters of the Hubbard model.
The dependence of the entropy per particle on the chemical potential is absent though. Qualitative similarities between our results and the results of~\citep{dLBKGS11} are as follows. The evolution of the entropy per cell as a function of $\mu^*$ at high temperature, i.e. $T^*=0.4$ in Figure~\ref{fig:entropy3}c, is similar to the entropy per site versus chemical potential for the Hubbard model at the weak interaction strength, cf. Fig.~5 from~\citep{dLBKGS11}. At the low temperature, our result at $T^*=0.3$ resembles that of~\citep[Fig.~6]{dLBKGS11} for the Hubbard model at the strong interaction strength. To see this similarity, we look at the interval $0.7 \leq \mu^* \leq 1.3$, where two maxima are observed for $S^*_v$ at $T^*=0.3$. The behavior of the entropy per cell versus density, Figure~\ref{fig:entropy3}d, at high temperature, i.e. $T^*=0.4$, is qualitatively the same as the entropy per site versus density of the Hubbard model at the weak interaction strength~\citep[Fig.~7]{dLBKGS11}. At low temperature, the qualitative similarity is observed in the region at $\rho \approx 1.0$, where the dips in the entropy per cell are developed in both models. Finally, we compare the entropy per particle $S^*$, Figure~\ref{fig:entropy3}b, with that of the Hubbard model from~\citep[Fig.~7]{dLBKGS11}. The high temperature regime in Figure~\ref{fig:entropy3}b clearly resembles the weak interaction strength regime in~\citep[Fig.~7]{dLBKGS11}. In turn, at the low temperature regime, $T^*=0.2$, for Phase II, the entropy per particle develops a dip at $\rho^* \approx 1$ analogously as in the Hubbard model at the strong interaction strength~\citep[Fig.~7]{dLBKGS11}.

Similar results for the entropy per site as a function of density are reported in studies~\citep{Campo15},~\citep{PKF20} where the one-dimensional repulsive Hubbard model was studied by different methods. As is seen in~\citep[Fig.~4]{Campo15} and~\citep[Fig.21a]{PKF20}, at high temperature the entropy per site of the Hubbard model has a single maximum, similarly to the entropy per cell in Figure~\ref{fig:entropy3}d at $T^*=0.4$. At low temperature, a minimum is developed at density $\rho^*=1.0$, similarly to $T^*=0.2$ in Figure~\ref{fig:entropy3}d.

In~\citep{PKvHT08} the entropy in the single-band Bose-Hubbard model is studied in one and two dimensions by the quantum Monte Carlo methods. The entropy per site as a function of the filling is presented in \citep[Fig.~2]{PKvHT08} for the homogeneous 1D Bose-Hubbard system. There the plot is extended up to the value of filling $n = 3.0$, and at the moment, this is the only study we found that reports the dependence of the entropy per site on the average occupancy number for the range in density beyond $\rho^* \approx 2.0$. In~\citep[Fig.~2]{PKvHT08}, we observe two dips at fillings $n = 1.0$ and $n = 2.0$, see the red curve for $U/t = 12$. Analogous dips are observed in our model as well, around $\rho^* \approx 1.0$ and $\rho^* \approx 2.0$, respectively, at $T^*=0.2$, see~Figure~\ref{fig:entropy3}d.

\section{Conclusions}

It is very interesting to note, that despite different physical natures, the allowance for maximum occupancy to be higher than one leads to outstandingly similar features in the mentioned models. The Hubbard model, allowing for $\rho^*_{\rm max} = 2.0$, develops a minima in the entropy per site at $\rho^* = 1.0$. The Bose-Hubbard model data, reported up to $\rho^* \leq 3.0$ show the minima for the entropy per site at $\rho^*=1.0$ and at $\rho^* = 2.0$. The cell model with the Curie-Weiss interaction considered in the current work does not have any restriction on the occupancy number, and thus develops the minima in the entropy per cell at $\rho^* \approx 1.0$, $\rho^* \approx 2.0$, $\rho^* \approx 3.0$, and so on. We expect this feature to appear in other multiple-occupancy lattice gas models as well. In particular, the entropy per cell in the double-occupancy lattice gas~\citep{LYZ21} should have a dip at $\rho^* = 1.0$. The generalized exponential model of index $4$ considered in \citep{Prestipino14,PGT15} in the context of cluster crystals, and the lattice gas model of multiple layer adsorption~\citep{dOG78} should both have minima in the entropy per site at integer-valued densities as both models exhibit multiple first-order phase transitions at sufficiently low temperatures, similar to the cell model studied by us. The same arguments apply to the entropy per particle as well.
